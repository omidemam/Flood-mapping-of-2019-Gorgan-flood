# Flood-mapping-of-2019-Gorgan-flood
In this repository, I share a class project in which I explored the GEE sentinel 1 SAR dataset potential to be used for flood mapping of the 2019 Gorgan flood. I also used night light as the recovery index of that area and NDVI to find contributing factors to this flood. All codes and the final presentation of this project are available.
