# Flood-mapping-of-2019-Gorgan-flood
In this repository, I share a class project in which I explored the Google Earth engine sentinel 1 SAR dataset potential to be used for flood mapping of the 2019 Gorgan flood (in the northern part of Iran) using the UN-spider approach. I also used night light to monitor the recovery rate of the area and NDVI to find contributing factors to this flooding event. All codes and the final presentation of this project are available.
